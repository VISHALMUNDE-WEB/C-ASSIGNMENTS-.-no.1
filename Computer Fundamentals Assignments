1) Explain Character Generation / Image generation.

    Ans.  A character generator adds characters or animated text to video in video-editing 
          applications. A character generator can be hardware or software based. character  
          generators are largely used during the broadcast of live television presentation or
          events. Most modern character generators are computer-based, and are capable of
          generating both text and graphics. Before the advent of the character generator 
          technology, adding titles to video images was done with help of dedicated camera
          shooting white letters on a black backgrounds, and then combining it with the video
          from the combining it with the video from the live-action camera to form a single image
          with while letters superimposed over it.

          Most character generators can produce different type sizes and fonts. hardware-based 
          character generators are mostly used in video editing suites and studios such as 
          television production studios. Hardware-based character generators generate graphics
          or text which are then encoded into high-quality video, digital video or RGB video
          signals. Software-based character generators are mostly found integrated with video
          editing applications and are often available in related software packages.

2) Explain the working of LCD.

    Ans.  The principle behind the LCD'S is that when an electrical current is applied to the 
          liquid crystal molecule, the molecule tends to untwist. This causes the angle of light
          which is passing through the molecule of the polarized glass and also cause a change
          in the angle of the top polarizing filter. As a result, a little light is allowed to pass the
          polarized glass through a particular area of the LCD. Thus that particular area will 
          become dark compared to others. The LCD works on the principle of the blocking 
          light. While constructing the LCD'S, a reflected mirror is arranged at the back.

          An electrode plane is made of indium-tin-oxide which is kept on top and a polarized
          glass with a polarizing film is also added on the bottom of the device. The complete 
          region of the LCD has to be enclosed by a common electrode and above it should be
          the liquid crystal matter. Next come the second piece of glass with an electrode in
          the form of the rectangle on the bottom and, on top, another polarizing film. It must
          be considered that both the pieces are kept at the right angles. When there is no
          current form it will cause the liquid crystals between the common-plane electrode
          and the electrode shaped like a rectangle to untwist. Thus the light is blocked from
          passing through. That particular rectangular area appears blank.

3) What is Firmware.Discuss?

Ans. In computing. Firmware Is a specific class of computer software that provides the 
     low-level control for  a device's specific hardware. Firmware can either provide a 
     a standardized operating environment for more complex device software for less
     complex devices. Act as the device's complete operating systems, performing all 
     control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. Typical examples of devices 
     containing firmware are embedded systems, consumer appliances, computers,
     computer peripherals, and others. Almost all electronic devices beyond the simplest
     contain some firmware.

     firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM 
     changing the firmware of a device was rarely or never done during its lifetime in the
     past but is nowadays a common procedure some firmware memory devices are 
     permanently installed and cannot be changed after manufacture. Common reasons
     for updating firmware include fixing bugs or adding features to the device. This 
     requires ROM integrated circuits to be physically replaced, or EPROM or  flash
     memory to be physically replaced, or EPROM or flash memory to be reprogrammed
     through a special procedure.
