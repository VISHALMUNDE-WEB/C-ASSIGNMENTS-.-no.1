1) Explain Character Generation / Image generation.

    Ans.  A character generator adds characters or animated text to video in video-editing 
          applications. A character generator can be hardware or software based. character  
          generators are largely used during the broadcast of live television presentation or
          events. Most modern character generators are computer-based, and are capable of
          generating both text and graphics. Before the advent of the character generator 
          technology, adding titles to video images was done with help of dedicated camera
          shooting white letters on a black backgrounds, and then combining it with the video
          from the combining it with the video from the live-action camera to form a single image
          with while letters superimposed over it.

          Most character generators can produce different type sizes and fonts. hardware-based 
          character generators are mostly used in video editing suites and studios such as 
          television production studios. Hardware-based character generators generate graphics
          or text which are then encoded into high-quality video, digital video or RGB video
          signals. Software-based character generators are mostly found integrated with video
          editing applications and are often available in related software packages.

2) Explain the working of LCD.

    Ans.  The principle behind the LCD'S is that when an electrical current is applied to the 
          liquid crystal molecule, the molecule tends to untwist. This causes the angle of light
          which is passing through the molecule of the polarized glass and also cause a change
          in the angle of the top polarizing filter. As a result, a little light is allowed to pass the
          polarized glass through a particular area of the LCD. Thus that particular area will 
          become dark compared to others. The LCD works on the principle of the blocking 
          light. While constructing the LCD'S, a reflected mirror is arranged at the back.

          An electrode plane is made of indium-tin-oxide which is kept on top and a polarized
          glass with a polarizing film is also added on the bottom of the device. The complete 
          region of the LCD has to be enclosed by a common electrode and above it should be
          the liquid crystal matter. Next come the second piece of glass with an electrode in
          the form of the rectangle on the bottom and, on top, another polarizing film. It must
          be considered that both the pieces are kept at the right angles. When there is no
          current form it will cause the liquid crystals between the common-plane electrode
          and the electrode shaped like a rectangle to untwist. Thus the light is blocked from
          passing through. That particular rectangular area appears blank.

3) What is Firmware.Discuss?

Ans. In computing. Firmware Is a specific class of computer software that provides the 
     low-level control for  a device's specific hardware. Firmware can either provide a 
     a standardized operating environment for more complex device software for less
     complex devices. Act as the device's complete operating systems, performing all 
     control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. Typical examples of devices 
     containing firmware are embedded systems, consumer appliances, computers,
     computer peripherals, and others. Almost all electronic devices beyond the simplest
     contain some firmware.

     firmware is held in non-volatile memory devices such as ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM 
     changing the firmware of a device was rarely or never done during its lifetime in the
     past but is nowadays a common procedure some firmware memory devices are 
     permanently installed and cannot be changed after manufacture. Common reasons
     for updating firmware include fixing bugs or adding features to the device. This 
     requires ROM integrated circuits to be physically replaced, or EPROM or  flash
     memory to be physically replaced, or EPROM or flash memory to be reprogrammed
     through a special procedure.

4) Difference between Hard disk, RAM and Cache

   Ans. 1) HARD DISK :

1) ram stands for random access memory.

2) Ram is also known as primary memory. Ram does not contains, mechanical parts, only electronical parts like transistors.

3) Ram has shorter r/w time.

4) In ram each and every element takes same time to be accessed.

5) In a system the ram is smaller than the hard disk.
   Ram is costlier per unit storage.

6) Ram does not produce noise.

7) Data stored in ram is temporary. It remembers as long as it has electricity, the power is on.

8) Inadequate ram slows down the speed speed of the computer.

       2) RAM :

1) HDD stands for hard disk drive.

2) HDD is also konwn as secondary memory.

3) HDD contains moving mechanical parts,like the arm.

4) HDD has longer r/w time.

5) in HDD different elements take different times to be accesed.

6) in a system the HDD is larger than the ram.

7) HDD is cheaper per unit storage. 

8) HDD can produce noise due to mechanical movements.

9) data stored in HDD is permanent, it reatains data even after shutdown.

10) HDD does not affect the speed of the computer.

       3) CACHE :

1) cache is a smaller and fast memory component in the computer.

2) the size is cache memory is less.

3) it is not expensive.

4) it holds frequently used data by the CPU.

5) it is faster.

6) cache memory increase the accessing speed of CPU.

7) it is generally internal.

5) Discuss different Levels of  Computer language

Levels of computer languages :

Types of languages :

There are three main kinds of programming languages :

1) Machine language
2) Assembly language
3) High-level language

1) Machine language: 

it’s the language of machines, consisting of bits
(1s and 0s) put together into chunks likes bytes, a group of 8 bits, and
Lots of other larger sizes. It's highly unlikely you will ever have to write
In machine language, but in the old days, we used to plot 1s and 0s on
Graph paper and then type them in, to make pictures appear on the
Computer screen.

2) Assembly language:

Mnemonics
• Assembly language is a little easier than machine language, but not much it uses more convenient numbers, symbols, and abbreviations to describe the huge strings of 1s and 0s, make it both easier and more memorable to type in instructions.
• The computer knows that certain strings of numbers are commands, so assembly language lets you use English-like strings instead of numbers to refer to those.
• Plus, with assembly language you have access to all kinds of resources to organize your programming code.
• Then you tell a program called an assembler to your instructions, which just means they get turned into 1s and 0s for you.

3) High-level languages:

• The third type of language are the high-level languages. These languages are use English-like statements and symbols, and are the independent of the type of computer you are using.
• You can even put in lots of English labels and comments to help remember what the instructions are doing.
• This makes your programs much easier to read and modify. There are far more high-level languages than any other type of computer language, each one tailored for a certain kind of use.
• Compiler high level language to low level language.

  Examples: java, c++, python Etc
