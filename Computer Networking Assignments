1) Discuss Cloud Network 

What is cloud computing:

Definition: A simple defination of cloud computing involves
delivering different types of services over the internet. Form
software and analytics to secure and safe data storage and
networking resources, everything can be delivered via the cloud you
can access it from just about any computer that has internet access.
Use of cloud computing: simply put, cloud computing is the
delivery of computing services – including servers, storage,
database, networking, software, analytic and intelligence - over the
internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and
economics of scale.

Types of cloud computing:

There are three main types of cloud computing:

1) infrastructure as a service ( laas ) 
2) platform as a service ( paas )
3) software as a service ( saas )

Advantages of cloud computing:

• Reduced it costs. Moving to cloud computing may reduce the
cost of managing and maintaining your it system.
• Scalability.
• Business continuity.
• Collaboration efficiency.
• Flexibility of work practices.
• Access of automatic updates.
• Also consider.

2) Explain the working of WI-Fi and Bluetooth?

What is WIFI ?

What is the Technoology ?
What is WIFI ?

A wireless or Wi-Fi network uses a
radio frequency signal instead of
wires to connect your devices –
such as computers, printers and
smartphones – to the internet and
each other. The Wi-Fi signal can be
picked up by any wireless-capable
device such as a laptop or tablet
within a certain distance in all
directions.

How WIFI works ?

Like mobile phones, a WIFI network
make use of radio waves to transmit
information across a network. The
computer should include a wireless
adapter that will translate data sent into a
radio signal the same same signal will be
transmitted, via an antena, to a decoder
knows as router. once decoded, the data
will be sent to the internet through a
wired ethernet connection.

What is Wi-Fi Technoology ?

Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity and
is the same thing as saying WLAN
which stands for " WIRELESS LOCAL
AREA NETWORK " WIFI works off
the same principle as other wireless
devices - it uses radio frequencies to
send signals between devices.

What is the range of Wi-Fi ?

Wi-Fi networks have a range
that’s limited by the frequency,
transmission power, antenna
type, the location they are used
in, and the environment. A
typical wireless router in an
indoor point – to – multipoint
arrangement using 802.11n and a
stock antenna might have a range
of 50 meters( 160 ) or less.

Examples of

devices that
use WIFI
• 1) computers.
• 2) digital photo frames.
• 3) streaming devices.
• 4) eBook readers.
• 5) DVR and set-top box.

What is
Bluetooth ?

What is the Technoology ?

What is bluetooth ?

Bluetooth is a wireless Technoology is a
de facto standard, as well as a
specification for small form factor, low
cost, short range radio links between
mobile PC'S, mobile phones, and other
portable devices.

How Bluetooth works ?

A Bluetooth device works by using
radio waves instead of wires or
cables to connect with your cell
phone, smartphone or computer,….
So when Bluetooth-enabled
products, such as a cell phone and
headphones, are in close proximity
to each other, they connect, or pair.
What is Bluetooth Technoology ?
Bluetooth Technoology is a short -
range wireless communications
Technoology to replace the cables
connecting electronic devices,
allowing a person to have a phone
conversation via a headset, use a
wireless mouse and synchronize
information from a mobile phone to
PC, using the same core system.
What is the range of Bluetooth ?
The effective range of
Bluetooth is 10 meters. You are
advised to perform all Bluetooth
operations while keeping your
phone within a 10-meter radius
from other Bluetooth devices.
This distance may vary according
to the environment in which you
use these devices.

What are the examples of Bluetooth
?
• 1) phones.
• 2) cameras.
• 3) television.
• 4) speakers.
• 5) headphones.

Difference between wifi and
Bluetooth ?
Bluetooth WIFI

1) Bluetooth has no full form. 1) wifi stands for wireless fidelity.
2) it requires bluetooth adapter on all
Devices to connectivity.
2) it requires wireless adapter on all
Devices and wireless router for
Connectivity.
3) bluetooth consume low power. 3) wifi consume high power.
4) the security of bluetooth is less in
Comparison of wifi.
4) wifi provides better security than
Bluetooth.
5) bluetooth is less flexible means in this,
Limited users are supported.
5) wifi supports larger amount of users.

4) Differentiate between Twisted pair, Coaxial cable & fibre optics?

What is twisted pair ?

What is twisted pair cable ?

Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors
of a signal circuit are twisted together for the purpose of
improving electromagnetic compatibility.

What is the use of twisted pair ?

Twisted-pair cable is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single
circuit are twisted together for the purpose of improving electromagnetic
compability.

Advantages of twisted pair cable :

❑Twisted pair cable are the oldest and most popular all over the world. This is due to the many
advantages that they offer:

▪ Trained personal easily available due to shallow learning curve.
▪ Can be used for bothanalog and digitaltransmissions.
▪ Leastexpensiveforshortdistances.
▪ Entire network does not go downif apartof networkis damaged.
Disadvantages of twisted pair cable :
▪ Signal cannot travel long distances without repearts.
▪ High error rate of distances greater than 100m.
▪ Very thin and hence breaks easily.
▪ Not suitable for broadband connections.

What is coaxial cable ?

Coaxial cable, or coax is a type of electric cable consisting of an inner conductor
surrounds by a concentric conducting shield, with the two seperated by a
dielectric; many coxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket.

Use of coaxial cable ?

Coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio
frequency signals. Its application include feedlines
connecting radio transmitters and receivers to
their antenas, computer network ( ex. Ethernet )
connections, digital audio , and distribution of cable
television signals.

Advantages of coaxial cables :

❑These are the advantages of coaxial cable :

▪ Signals can travel longerdistancesat higherspeeds ex: 1 to 2 gbps for1 kmcable.
▪ Can be used for both analogand digital signals.
▪ Inexpensive as compared to fibre opticcables.
▪ Easy to install and maintain.

Disadvantages of coaxial cable :

❑These are some disadvantages of coaxial cable :

▪ Expensive as compared to twisted pair cables.
▪ Not compatible with twisted pair cables.

What is fiber optics ?

An optical fiber is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than
that of a human hair.

Use of fiber cables :

Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber –
optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidth ( data transfer rates ) than
electrical cables.

Advantages of fiber optical cable :

▪ Able to carry significantly more signals than wire.
▪ Faster data transmission.
▪ Less susceptible to noise from other devices.
▪ Better security for signals during transmission.
▪ Smaller physical size.

Disadvantages of fiber optic cables :

▪ Cost is more than twisted pair and coaxial cable.
▪ Can be difficult to install and modify.
▪ More expensive over shorter distances.
