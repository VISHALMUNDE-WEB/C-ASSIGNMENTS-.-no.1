2) Explain the working of WI-Fi and Bluetooth?

What is WIFI ?

What is the Technoology ?
What is WIFI ?

A wireless or Wi-Fi network uses a
radio frequency signal instead of
wires to connect your devices –
such as computers, printers and
smartphones – to the internet and
each other. The Wi-Fi signal can be
picked up by any wireless-capable
device such as a laptop or tablet
within a certain distance in all
directions.

How WIFI works ?

Like mobile phones, a WIFI network
make use of radio waves to transmit
information across a network. The
computer should include a wireless
adapter that will translate data sent into a
radio signal the same same signal will be
transmitted, via an antena, to a decoder
knows as router. once decoded, the data
will be sent to the internet through a
wired ethernet connection.

What is Wi-Fi Technoology ?

Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity and
is the same thing as saying WLAN
which stands for " WIRELESS LOCAL
AREA NETWORK " WIFI works off
the same principle as other wireless
devices - it uses radio frequencies to
send signals between devices.

What is the range of Wi-Fi ?

Wi-Fi networks have a range
that’s limited by the frequency,
transmission power, antenna
type, the location they are used
in, and the environment. A
typical wireless router in an
indoor point – to – multipoint
arrangement using 802.11n and a
stock antenna might have a range
of 50 meters( 160 ) or less.

Examples of

devices that
use WIFI
• 1) computers.
• 2) digital photo frames.
• 3) streaming devices.
• 4) eBook readers.
• 5) DVR and set-top box.

What is
Bluetooth ?

What is the Technoology ?

What is bluetooth ?

Bluetooth is a wireless Technoology is a
de facto standard, as well as a
specification for small form factor, low
cost, short range radio links between
mobile PC'S, mobile phones, and other
portable devices.

How Bluetooth works ?

A Bluetooth device works by using
radio waves instead of wires or
cables to connect with your cell
phone, smartphone or computer,….
So when Bluetooth-enabled
products, such as a cell phone and
headphones, are in close proximity
to each other, they connect, or pair.
What is Bluetooth Technoology ?
Bluetooth Technoology is a short -
range wireless communications
Technoology to replace the cables
connecting electronic devices,
allowing a person to have a phone
conversation via a headset, use a
wireless mouse and synchronize
information from a mobile phone to
PC, using the same core system.
What is the range of Bluetooth ?
The effective range of
Bluetooth is 10 meters. You are
advised to perform all Bluetooth
operations while keeping your
phone within a 10-meter radius
from other Bluetooth devices.
This distance may vary according
to the environment in which you
use these devices.

What are the examples of Bluetooth
?
• 1) phones.
• 2) cameras.
• 3) television.
• 4) speakers.
• 5) headphones.

Difference between wifi and
Bluetooth ?
Bluetooth WIFI

1) Bluetooth has no full form. 1) wifi stands for wireless fidelity.
2) it requires bluetooth adapter on all
Devices to connectivity.
2) it requires wireless adapter on all
Devices and wireless router for
Connectivity.
3) bluetooth consume low power. 3) wifi consume high power.
4) the security of bluetooth is less in
Comparison of wifi.
4) wifi provides better security than
Bluetooth.
5) bluetooth is less flexible means in this,
Limited users are supported.
5) wifi supports larger amount of users.

3) Discuss different Types of Computer Viruses

What is a Computer Virus?

A computer virus is a piece of code embedded in a legitimate program and is created with the ability to self-replicate infecting other programs on a computer. Just like how humans catch a cold or flu, it can remain dormant inside the system and gets activated when you least expect it.
A computer virus is developed to spread from one host to another and there are numerous ways on how your computer catches it. It can be through email attachments, file downloads, software installations, or unsecured links.
These viruses can steal your data such as passwords, hacked into your social media accounts or online banking accounts, and even wiped out all your data.

Common Types Of Computer Viruses

Cybercriminals are getting better and better at stealing our confidential data and viruses that are being created are evolving rapidly. There are millions of viruses around the world, but here are some common types you should be aware of:

1. File-infecting Virus
A virus that attached itself to an executable program. It is also called a parasitic virus which typically infects files with .exe or .com extensions. Some file infectors can overwrite host files and others can damage your hard drive’s formatting.

2. Macro Virus
This type of virus is commonly found in programs such as Microsoft Word or Excel. These viruses are usually stored as part of a document and can spread when the files are transmitted to other computers, often through email attachments.

3. Browser Hijacker
This virus targets and alters your browser setting. It is often called a browser redirect virus because it redirects your browser to other malicious websites that you don’t have any intention of visiting. This virus can pose other threats such as changing the default home page of your browser.

4. Web Scripting Virus
A very sneaky virus that targets popular websites. What this virus does is overwrite code on a website and insert links that can install malicious software on your device. Web scripting viruses can steal your cookies and use the information to post on your behalf on the infected website.

5. Boot Sector Virus
These viruses are once common back when computers are booted from floppy disks. Today, these viruses are found distributed in forms of physical media such as external hard drives or USB. If the computer is infected with a boot sector virus, it automatically loads into the memory enabling control of your computer.

6. Polymorphic Virus
This virus has the capability to evade anti-virus programs since it can change codes every time an infected file is performed.

7. Resident Virus
A resident virus stores itself on your computer’s memory which allows it to infect files on your computer. This virus can interfere with your operating system leading to file and program corruption.

8. Multipartite Virus
A type of virus that is very infectious and can easily spread on your computer system. It can infect multiple parts of a system including memory, files, and boot sector which makes it difficult to contain.

Protection Against These Types Computer Viruses
A virus left untreated can wreak havoc on your device but if detected early, and appropriate measures are done, then the recovery would be quick. Just like how we protect ourselves from catching a virus, here are a few notes to remember to help keep your devices safe.

Avoid clicking on suspicious links.
Scan email attachments before opening it.
Avoid clicking on pop-up advertisements and get a pop-up blocker for your web browser.
When routed to another website, don’t do anything, and immediately leave the site.
Install a reliable anti-virus program and always keep it up to date.

4) Differentiate between Twisted pair, Coaxial cable & fibre optics?

What is twisted pair ?

What is twisted pair cable ?

Twisted pair cabling is a type of wiring in which two conductors
of a signal circuit are twisted together for the purpose of
improving electromagnetic compatibility.

What is the use of twisted pair ?

Twisted-pair cable is a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single
circuit are twisted together for the purpose of improving electromagnetic
compability.

Advantages of twisted pair cable :

❑Twisted pair cable are the oldest and most popular all over the world. This is due to the many
advantages that they offer:

▪ Trained personal easily available due to shallow learning curve.
▪ Can be used for bothanalog and digitaltransmissions.
▪ Leastexpensiveforshortdistances.
▪ Entire network does not go downif apartof networkis damaged.
Disadvantages of twisted pair cable :
▪ Signal cannot travel long distances without repearts.
▪ High error rate of distances greater than 100m.
▪ Very thin and hence breaks easily.
▪ Not suitable for broadband connections.

What is coaxial cable ?

Coaxial cable, or coax is a type of electric cable consisting of an inner conductor
surrounds by a concentric conducting shield, with the two seperated by a
dielectric; many coxial cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket.

Use of coaxial cable ?

Coaxial cable is used as a transmission line for radio
frequency signals. Its application include feedlines
connecting radio transmitters and receivers to
their antenas, computer network ( ex. Ethernet )
connections, digital audio , and distribution of cable
television signals.

Advantages of coaxial cables :

❑These are the advantages of coaxial cable :

▪ Signals can travel longerdistancesat higherspeeds ex: 1 to 2 gbps for1 kmcable.
▪ Can be used for both analogand digital signals.
▪ Inexpensive as compared to fibre opticcables.
▪ Easy to install and maintain.

Disadvantages of coaxial cable :

❑These are some disadvantages of coaxial cable :

▪ Expensive as compared to twisted pair cables.
▪ Not compatible with twisted pair cables.

What is fiber optics ?

An optical fiber is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than
that of a human hair.

Use of fiber cables :

Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber –
optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidth ( data transfer rates ) than
electrical cables.

Advantages of fiber optical cable :

▪ Able to carry significantly more signals than wire.
▪ Faster data transmission.
▪ Less susceptible to noise from other devices.
▪ Better security for signals during transmission.
▪ Smaller physical size.

Disadvantages of fiber optic cables :

▪ Cost is more than twisted pair and coaxial cable.
▪ Can be difficult to install and modify.
▪ More expensive over shorter distances.

5) What is Phishing?

What is a phishing attack

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

Moreover, phishing is often used to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced persistent threat (APT) event. In this latter scenario, employees are compromised in order to bypass security perimeters, distribute malware inside a closed environment, or gain privileged access to secured data.

An organization succumbing to such an attack typically sustains severe financial losses in addition to declining market share, reputation, and consumer trust. Depending on scope, a phishing attempt might escalate into a security incident from which a business will have a difficult time recovering.

Phishing attack examples
The following illustrates a common phishing scam attempt:

A spoofed email ostensibly from myuniversity.edu is mass-distributed to as many faculty members as possible.
The email claims that the user’s password is about to expire. Instructions are given to go to myuniversity.edu/renewal to renew their password within 24 hours.
